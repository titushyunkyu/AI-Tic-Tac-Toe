# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe


## A Tic-Tac-Toe application with the option to either play with two players or go against an AI computer model. 

This project is an AI Tic-Tac-Toe application written in Python. Within the application, the user can either play a regular game of Tic-Tac-Toe with two players or go against the computer. The AI program is coded to implement a Pure Monte-Carlo Tree Search Algorithm. Within the AI program, the user also has the choice to set the difficulty of the computer model.

To run the code and navigate through the application:
   * The main file for this code that actually runs this application is main.py. With all other files downloaded and within the same file, run the main.py file. Follow the instructions provided within the application to navigate through the application.
   * The ai_computer.py file contains all the code for the AI program, and the 2-player.py file contains all the code for the regular two-player Tic-Tac-Toe. 
   * When prompted to give an answer to a choice, make sure to answer in small letters and without any spaces (simply 'a' or 'b')
   * When choosing a move, make sure to follow the provided format. The format is (row col) with one space between the row and col and no other spaces or additional text. Simply type (number) space (number), then hit enter.
   * Be aware that when "extremely hard" or "hard" are chosen for the difficulty, there may be some loading time for the computer's move since the number of simulations is so big (100000 and 1000, respectively).
